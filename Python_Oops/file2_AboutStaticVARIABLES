About STATIC VARIABLES:-
-------------------------
->If the value of a variable is not varied from object to object,then it is not recommended to declare those variables as instance variable.We have to declare at class level as static variables.
->In thecase of instance variables,for every object a separate copy will be created.But in the caseof static Variables at class level only one copy will be created and shared every object of that class.
->Most of  the times,statc variables  should be declared within the class directly.

Various Places to declare Static Variables:-
------------------------------------------
1)In general we can declare static varibles within the class directly but outside os by method or construnctor
2)Inside constructor by uding class name
3)Inside instance method by using class name.
4)Inside class method by using  either class name or cls variable
5)Inside static method by using class name.
6)From outside of the class by using classname.
Ex:-
class Text:
    a=10
    def __init__(self):
        Text.b=20
    def m1(self):
        Text.c=30
    @classmethod
    def m2(cls):
        cls.d=40
        Text.e=50
    @staticmethod
    def m3():
        Text.f=60
Text.g=70

Differenct Way to access static Variable:-
-----------------------------------------
1)Inside constructor either by using self or by class name.
2)Inside instance method either by self or by class name.
3)Inside class method either by using cls or by class name. 
4)Inside static method by using classname.
5)Outside of the class,by using classname or by using object reference.

Ex:-
class Text:
    a=10
    def __int__(self):
        print (self.a)
        print (Text.a)
    def m1(self):
        print (self.a)
        print (Text.a)
    @classmethod
    def m2(cls):
        print (cls.a)
        print (Text.a)
    @static method
    def m3():
        print (Text.a)
t=Text()
print (t.a)
print (Text.a)

Where We can modify the value of static Variable:-
-------------------------------------------------
We can modify the value of static variable anywhere(Either within the class or outside of the class)by using class name.
But inside classmethod,we can also use cls variable.
[Note:-We cannot modify static variable value by using self or object reference]

Ex:-
class Text:
    a=10
    def __init__(self):
        Text.a=20
    def m1(self):
        Text.a=30
    @classmethod
    def m2(cls):
        cls.a=40
        Text.a=50
    @staticmethod
    def m3():
        Text.a=60
Text.a=70
